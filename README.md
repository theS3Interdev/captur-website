## Description

Sample project to build and deploy a fully responsive website incorporating the image component of Next.JS.

This means that all of the images in the project will take advantage of lazy loading. An image slider will also be built and it will also lazy load all the images which will result in faster load times and increased search engine optimization for the website.

Since Next.JS offers a built in routing system and the Link component, we do not have to use the react-router-dom as we normally would when handling routing in React.JS applications. 

The project also puts into practice proper management of Git by organizing code into staging and production ready branches so that there is always a version of the code ready to go.

Finally, the repetitive process of building and deploying the project to production is automated by using Vercel to automatically deploy everytime the `main` GitHub branch is updated.
